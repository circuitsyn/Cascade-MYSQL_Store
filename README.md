##Welome to Cascade! WHere the Prices are always falling!
Cascade is a full shopping market that contains three separate abilities with sub-features. There are customer, manager and supervisor sections. In the following I will break each section down with video demos. This application is built using Node.JS, the NPM and MYSQL. 


## Cascade - Customer
In the customer section you can purchase any item in the inventory that is in stock. There is a great selection and money is unlimited!:wink:
